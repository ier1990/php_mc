# PHP Tree File Viewer

This project provides a modern, user-friendly file browser for PHP environments. It includes a real-time directory tree, live code previews with syntax highlighting, metadata display, and support for image and PDF previewing.

## Features

- 📂 **Directory Tree UI** – Navigate directories using a left-pane tree view
- 📝 **File Preview** – View code files with syntax highlighting (Highlight.js)
- 🖼️ **Image and PDF Support** – Display images and PDFs inline in the right pane
- 📜 **Metadata Display** – View permissions, file size, and file ownership
- 🌙 **Dark Theme** – Low-vision friendly layout with white-on-black readability

## Technologies Used

- PHP (7.3+ and 8.x supported)
- Bootstrap 3 for layout
- Highlight.js for syntax highlighting

## Usage

Upload the file as `mc.php` or similar inside your project root. Then access it via your browser:

```
http://yourdomain.com/admin/mc.php
```

You can navigate folders, preview files, and view server paths.

## Roadmap Ideas

- [x] Dark mode and metadata overlay
- [x] Syntax highlighting with Highlight.js
- [ ] Tag or flag files for future review
- [ ] AI-enhanced indexing or refactoring queue
- [ ] Notes/comments on files saved in SQLite
